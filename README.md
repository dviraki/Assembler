Assembler Program

This program is designed to take assembly code as input and convert it into machine language code. It operates in a 3-step process:

    1. Pre-assembler: This stage primarily focuses on expanding macros. More detailed documentation is available in the pre-assembler program files.

    2. First-parse: Parsing the .am files generated by the pre-assembler.

    3. Second-parse: Parsing the .am files again, mainly for symbol binaries.

Upon completion, the program outputs a machine language code file with a .obj extension.

Compilation and Execution

To compile the program, navigate to the project directory and run:

make

This command will compile all the necessary modules and link them to create the assembler executable.

To execute the program, use the following command:

bash

./assembler [input_files]

Replace [input_files] with the filenames of the assembly code files you want to process.
